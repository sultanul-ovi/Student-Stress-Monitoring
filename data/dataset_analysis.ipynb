    "This dataset supports the analysis and detection of mental health states (stress, anxiety, cognitive overload) using wearable IoT sensors. It includes readings from EEG and GSR sensors worn by students in different session contexts. The dataset enables modeling of mental health conditions in real time by linking sensor data with emotional and cognitive states.\n",
